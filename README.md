# Nyasshu !
a simple and hacky (proof of concept) http relay that caches requests  
let me take a minute of your time to talk about the marvelous crap  
that this POS (Piece Of Software) "implies" it can do!  

first of all , DO NOT FOR ANY REASON USE THIS SOFTWARE IN A PRODUCTION  
ENVIRONMENT, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA BREECHES OR THEFTS  

now with that out of the way lemme simply tell you that  
one: there is no encryption  
two: data is stored in pickle format unefficiently  
three: non of my 2 brain cells were working when i hacked this POS  

### So uhh.. will you ever make this somewhat okay to use?
depends.. guess if i really want to or if enough people (5) insist  

### Anything i need to know?
just run it , it'll tell you  

### dependencies
requests, flask, NekoMimi

### Dev contact
